<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Cole Burnside and I'm a 34 year old from Charlotte, NC. I'm married to my amazing wife Jacquelin and we have 2 dogs, Aho and Tequila. I own a pest control business 
that operates all around the Charlotte area.</p>

<p>2 years ago I started learning programming and have been teaching myself with online resources ever since.
This website is one of my first projects and it's been a fun and challenging process of learning. I started learning
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My goal is to build a website on my own for my pest control business. Maybe one day
be able to make some money with this hobby, who knows. </p>
