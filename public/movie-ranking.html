<h2> My Top 3 All-Time Movies </h2>

<hr />

<h3> #1. Lone Survivor </h3>

<p>
  My favorite movie based on the true story of Navy Seals Mike Murphy and Marcus Lattrell. Peter Berg directs
  the movie that stars Mark Wahlberg and Taylor Klitsch.

<h3> #2. John Wick </h3>

<p>
  Action, action, and more action! This movie features Keanu Reeves as John Wick on a revenge tour for Russian
  mobsters killing John's dog. John's dog was a gift from his late wife, the last gift she left for him. John doesn't stop until every last person 
  associated with his dog's killing, is gone.

<h3> #3. Remember the Titans </h3>

<p>
  Denzel Washington stars in this movie that takes place during the Civil Rights Era of the United States. His football team is the first
  to assemble players of Black and White races. He's tasked with getting these players to trust and believe in each other when the rest 
  of the town does not agree with the assimilation in the local high school.
